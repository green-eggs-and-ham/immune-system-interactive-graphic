## Description ##

A personal school project to model the behaviour of the human immune system as a network graph with interactive visualisation.  

Written in JavaScript using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) library.

For the first-release MVP, nodes and links are coded into `sketch.js`. A user can step through stages of the immune response to an attack using a menu and see the different interactions between critical components of each stage of the immune response.
